### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  My name is Luke Yost, and I am a developing Software Developer! I am learning Full-Stack Web Development with CodeWorks Boise. I have mostly done front-end projects in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have used Bootstrap as a framework for CSS. I am currently learning to use Node.js with MongoDB to make back-end applications and Vue as a front-end framework. These skills will enable me to create beautiful, reactive Full-Stack Web Applications! I've loved learning just about everything relating to development! From learning for-loops from Youtube tutorials to presently creating entire Web Applications, I have loved every moment of my Software Development journey. Although I have made significant progress in my journey so far, at the same time, I know that I know nothing. I plan to continue exploring and learning as much as possible for the foreseeable future. I cannot wait to see what my future holds for all aspects of my life and career in this incredible field!

Outside of Software Development, I enjoy reading, climbing, and spending as much time as possible in the beautiful outdoors. I also really enjoy video games and learning 3d modeling with CAD software. Recently I have been spending so much time in front of a monitor learning Web Development that in my remaining time, I try to avoid activities that also involve sitting and looking at a screen.

  
  âš¡ Fun fact: I swam competitively for ten years, and during my First year of college, I swam for the University of Utah's D1 Swimming and Diving team.
