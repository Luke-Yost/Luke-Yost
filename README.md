### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  My name is Luke Yost and I am a developing Software Developer! I am learning Web Development with CodeWorks Boise. I have mostly done front end projects in HTML CSS and JavaScript. I have used Bootstrap as a framework for CSS. I am currently learning to use Node.js with MongoDB to make back-end applications, and Vue as a front-end framework. This will combine to enable me to create beautiful, reactive full-stack web applications! I've loved learning just about everything realating to development! From learning how search functions work in online CS classes, to the weird history of how HTML grew from a way for Universities and other institutions to share research papers to the framework that massive web applications are built on now, I have enjoyed every moment of it. I have made great progress in my journey so far, and plan on continuously learning new material for the foreseeable future. I cannot wait to see what my future holds for my all aspects of my life and career in this incredible field!
